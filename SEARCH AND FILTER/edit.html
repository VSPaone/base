    <p>The case of Zomato, where a single restaurant can deliver at multiple locations, the number of unique popularity_{area_id} fields can quickly accumulate, especially when considering all the restaurants in India. <br>This scenario is just one of the many examples that can cause a substantial increase in the total number of unique fields.<br> Furthermore, the system comprises of various document types, each with its own set of dynamic fields, which can exacerbate the issue, resulting in a field mapping explosion. <br>This situation can lead to out-of-memory errors and make recovery difficult. Moreover, the high field count can also adversely affect full indexing speed. Using dynamic fields, even if itâ€™s one of the most conventional design patterns, for unbounded fields, is not a scalable or sustainable solution in the long run</p>
